    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Ever wished your final dinner party course could be bundled together and sliced? This cheeseboard cheesecake,
        packed with ricotta, cheddar and Stilton, takes the biscuit! Serve with a juicy bunch of grapes on top for added
        impact.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>200g rough oatcakes</li>
        <li>125g butter, melted</li>
        <li>200g full-fat soft cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>250g ricotta, at room temperature</li>
        <li>100g mature Cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>100g blue Stilton, crumbled</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>200g mixed grapes</li>
        <li>thyme sprigs, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 3, 160 ̊C, fan 140 ̊C. Grease and line a 20cm loose-bottomed round tin. Blitz the
            oatcakes in a food processor, or bash with a rolling pin to make fine crumbs. Stir in the melted butter,
            then spoon into the prepared tin and press down firmly.</li>
        <li>Beat together the soft cheese, ricotta and Cheddar in a large bowl until combined. Fold in the blue cheese
            and eggs, then spoon into the tin. Bake for 1 hr-1 hr 10 mins until almost fully set. Leave to cool
            completely. Transfer to the fridge for 1 hr before decorating with the grapes and thyme sprigs, if you like,
            to serve. Will keep for up to 5 days in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
