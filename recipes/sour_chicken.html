        <li>Return the chicken to the wok and pour over the sauce. Cook, stirring, for 3-4 mins, until the sauce is
            glossy and thickened and the chicken is cooked through with no pink meat showing. Divide the chicken between
            plates and scatter over the remaining spring onions and a little extra chilli. Serve with rice.</li>
